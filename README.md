# TRUEHD-Check-Script
A python script to scrape movie database using Tautulli API to find movies that contain only a TRUEHD audio channel with no 5.1 backup.

Note I am no python coder and the majority of this was wrote with ChatGPT assistance.

My audio setup does not play nicely with TRUEHD 7.1 audio codecs and I wanted a script to scrape my movie database in order to show me which movies contained a TRUEHD code with no 5.1 channel backup audio.

Requirements;
Python 3

The requests module:

Install it if needed with: pip install requests
